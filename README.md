## Assignment Summary
Completely filling a plane with tiles of different shapes is a computational challenge that goes back to ancient times. Formally this process is called “tessellation”. In this assignment I solved this challenge by drawing “tiles” (rectangular images) in a grid using automatically-generated solutions. I was provided a Python list, to place differently-sized tiles in various locations in the grid. When this is done properly the grid will be entirely filled with non-overlapping tiles. Most importantly, the pattern to be followed is generated randomly, so the solution must be sufficiently general that it can work correctly for any possible pattern of tiles that fills the grid.
